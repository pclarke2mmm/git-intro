# Example Repo for Intro to Git and Github

Testing out some changes

## Setting Up

1. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install Git (my recommendation - use default settings, but change Git's default text editor to the editor of your choice)

3. Using a terminal (git bash, cmd, powershell, etc.), run this command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pclarke2mmm/git-intro.git
    ```

    If the above command doesn't work, you may need to connect to the VPN, or you can try cloning with SSH:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:pclarke2mmm/git-intro.git
    ```

    Cloning with SSH requires [Configuring SSH Keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
